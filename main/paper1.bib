abstract = {First-principles methods based on density functional theory are used extensively in the investigation of the behavior and properties of mantle materials over broad ranges of pressure, temperature, and composition that are relevant. A review of computational results reported during the last couple of decades shows that essentially all properties including structure, phase transition, equation of state, thermodynamics, elasticity, alloying, conductivity, defects, interfaces, diffusivity, viscosity, and melting have been calculated from first principles. Using MgO, the second most abundant oxide of Earth's mantle, as a primary example and considering many other mantle materials in their crystalline and amorphous phases, we have found that most properties are strongly pressure dependent, sometimes varying non-monotonically and anomalously, with the effects of temperature being systematically suppressed with compression. The overall agreement with the available experimental data is excellent; it is remarkable that the early-calculated results such as shear wave velocities of two key phases, MgO and MgSiO3 perovskite, were subsequently reproduced by experimentation covering almost the entire mantle pressure regime. As covered in some detail, the defect formation and migration enthalpies of key mantle materials increase with pressure. The predicted trend is that partial MgO Schottky defects are energetically most favorable in Mg-silicates but their formation enthalpies are high. So, the diffusion in the mantle is likely to be in the extrinsic regime. Preliminary results on MgO and forsterite hint that the grain boundaries can accommodate point defects (including impurities) and enhance diffusion rates at all pressures. The structures are highly distorted in the close vicinity of the defects and at the interface with excess space. Recent simulations of MgO-SiO2 binary and other silicate melts have found that the melt self-diffusion and viscosity vary by several orders of magnitudes with pressure, temperature, and composition. The predicted high compressibility and complex dynamical behavior can be associated with structural changes (involving non-bridging oxygen, oxygen tri-clusters, Si-O pentahedra, etc.) occurring on compression. We envision future prospect for massively parallel/distributed computing of unprecedented magnitude and scope in the study of relevant materials for Earth, super-Earth, and other planets. A renewed computational theme perhaps should be the first-principles simulations of large systems (with long runs) that are necessary to explore realistic (natural) compositions, polycrystalline phases, multi-component melts, crystal/melt interfaces, trace element partitioning, etc.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivities of empty and water-filled single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with diameters between 0.83 and 1.36 nm and lengths ranging from 200 to 1400 nm are predicted using molecular dynamics simulation. Using a direct application of the Fourier law, we explore the transition to fully diffusive phonon transport with increasing CNT length. For empty CNTs, we find that the CNT length required to obtain fully diffusive phonon transport decreases from 1090 nm for the 0.83-nm-diameter CNT to 510 nm for the 1.36-nm-diameter CNT. The magnitude of the fully diffusive thermal conductivity also decreases monotonically with increasing CNT diameter. We find that the fully diffusive thermal conductivity of water-filled CNTs is 20{\%}–35{\%} lower than that of empty CNTs. By examining the empty and water-filled CNT density of states, we attribute the thermal conductivity reductions to an increase in low-frequency acoustic phonon scattering due to interactions with the water molecules.},

@article{Plimpton1995,
abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter–atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently — those with short–range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed–memory parallel machine which allows for message–passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard–Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers—the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y–MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840–node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade–offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. This},

annote = {DIRECT METHOD
































the direct method of calculating thermal conductivity is analogous to experiment
































particle velocities are altered at each time step to change the kinetic energy, energy and thus heat is added to/taken from the system. 
































a quarter of the way along the cell, heat is added, a quarter from the opposite end heat is removed. this sets up a heat current, resulting in a temperature gradient that can be calculated. fourier's law is used alongside this to calculate the thermal conductivity. 
































an error is created, by the drift of the system's centre of mass. local temperature must be defined using velocities obtained in a system with zero centre of mass velocity.
































*ballistic energy currents
































the direct method calculates the thermal conductivity only in the direction of the heat current. for other directions new calculations and experimental cells must be set up.
































the direct method involves large temperature gradients, well outside of the experimental range. it is not immediately obvious that the direct method results will be consistent with experiment. very large temperature gradients may induce non linear effects around the source and sink, such that fourier's law does not apply.
strong non-linear temperature profiles are observed (in this calculation) around 6nm of the source and sink, which is attributed to scattering caused by heating. outside of these regions, temperatures can be fit with a linear profile. two profiles are fit (across the cell and over the boundary) and used to create an error estimate for the thermal conductivity.
































* infinite system extrapolation
an important feature of the simulation cell is the boundaries around the edges of the source and sink. the atomic dynamics in the slabs are altered by the simulation, causing the mean free path to be limited by the size of the system (casimir limit). however, finite size analysis on smaller systems means it is possible to get a good estimate for an infinte system.
































the direct method requires that steady state flow be achieved, a stationary temperature profile as a function of time. only when steady-state currents are flowing can thermal conductivity be calculated from fourier's law. for a limited number of time steps, temperature fluctuations are statistical, but on longer timescales transient effects (relating to the establishment of steady state thermal current) can be observed.
































to check that fourier's law is obeyed and that nonlinear effects are unimportant, it is necessary to check that the computed TC does not depend on the heat of the system. this study found TC to vary with heat, for both extremes. small heats result in large TC error bars, because the magnitude of temperature difference across the cell can be similar to the statistical noise. large values are unsuitable as they create non linear effects. a range of heats are tested, and the one with the smallest error bars are chosen going forwards.
































finite size effects arise when the cell is not significantly longer than the phonon mean free path. this is caused by scattering effects that occur at the interfaces with the source/sink. thermal conductivity is limited by the system size, when the system size is smaller than the mean-free path in an infinite system (casimir).
































*ballistic phono transport / solitonlike modes
































TC does depend on the dimensions to current flow, but not by much. smaller cross-sectional areas produce larger TCs for equivalent current densities. TC from a 2x2xN system compared to a 4x4xN system will be at most 20{\%} larger, and systems larger than 3x3xN agree within error},

abstract = {The amount of heat flowing from Earth's core critically determines the thermo-chemical evolution of both the core and the lower mantle. Consisting primarily of a polycrystalline aggregate of silicate perovskite and ferropericlase, the thermal boundary layer at the very base of Earth's lower mantle regulates the heat flow from the core, so that the thermal conductivity (k) of these mineral phases controls the amount of heat entering the lowermost mantle. Here we report measurements of the lattice thermal conductivity of pure, Al-, and Fe-bearing MgSiO(3) perovskite at 26 GPa up to 1,073 K, and of ferropericlase containing 0, 5, and 20{\%} Fe, at 8 and 14 GPa up to 1,273 K. We find the incorporation of these elements in silicate perovskite and ferropericlase to result in a ∼50{\%} decrease of lattice thermal conductivity relative to the end member compositions. A model of thermal conductivity constrained from our results indicates that a peridotitic mantle would have k = 9.1 ± 1.2 W/m K at the top of the thermal boundary layer and k = 8.4 ± 1.2 W/m K at its base. These values translate into a heat flux of 11.0 ± 1.4 terawatts (TW) from Earth's core, a range of values consistent with a variety of geophysical estimates.},

@article{Howell2012,
abstract = {We compare the molecular dynamics Green-Kubo and direct methods for calculating thermal conductivity $\kappa$, using as a test case crystalline silicon at temperatures T in the range 500-1000 K (classical regime). We pay careful attention to the convergence with respect to simulation size and duration and to the procedures used to fit the simulation data. We show that in the Green-Kubo method the heat current autocorrelation function is characterized by three decay processes, of which the slowest lasts several tens of picoseconds so that convergence requires several tens of nanoseconds of data. Using the Stillinger-Weber potential we find excellent agreement between the two methods. We also use the direct method to calculate $\kappa$(T) for the Tersoff potential and find that the magnitude and the temperature-dependence are different for the two potentials and that neither potential agrees with experimental data. We argue that this implies that using the Stillinger-Weber or Tersoff potentials to predict trends in kappa as some system parameter is varied may yield results which are specific to the potential but not intrinsic to Si.},
