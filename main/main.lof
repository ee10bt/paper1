  \caption{Normalised ACF. Correlation is taken over a longer length than shown on this plot (10 ps, see Figure 8 below), however the function decays to less than 1\% of its initial value at 2~ps. It continues to oscillate about zero, with a positive average value.}

  \caption{Integrated ACF, multiplied by constants to get thermal conductivity. Large variation in the first 1 ps corresponds to the correlation time where the ACF is unconverged (still decaying / large oscillations). Thermal conductivity is averaged from correlation time of 5~ps - 10~ps (region in red box).}
